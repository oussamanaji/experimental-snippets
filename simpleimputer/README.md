# Missing Value Imputation Analyzer

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of missing value imputation strategies using the SimpleImputer library, evaluating their impact on various machine learning models.

## Features
- Compares different imputation techniques, such as mean, median, and most frequent value imputation
- Evaluates the effectiveness and robustness of each approach
- Covers a wide range of machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, random forests, and support vector machines
- Demonstrates expertise in data preprocessing, handling missing data, and developing reliable machine learning pipelines
- Provides valuable insights for data scientists and researchers working with incomplete datasets

## Methodology
1. **Data Loading**: The dataset with missing values is loaded and explored to understand the extent and patterns of missingness.
2. **Imputation Techniques**: Different imputation strategies, such as mean, median, and most frequent value imputation, are applied using the SimpleImputer library.
3. **Model Training**: Various machine learning models, including logistic regression, random forests, and support vector machines, are trained on the imputed datasets.
4. **Model Evaluation**: The trained models are evaluated using appropriate metrics to assess the impact of each imputation strategy on model performance.
5. **Comparative Analysis**: The results of different imputation techniques are compared and analyzed to identify the most effective approach for the given dataset and machine learning task.

## Results
- The analysis revealed the impact of different imputation strategies on the performance of machine learning models.
- The mean imputation technique demonstrated the best overall performance across multiple models, improving accuracy and reducing bias compared to other approaches.
- The evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, provided a comprehensive assessment of the imputation techniques' effectiveness.
- The project highlights the importance of carefully selecting an appropriate imputation strategy based on the dataset characteristics and the specific machine learning task.
