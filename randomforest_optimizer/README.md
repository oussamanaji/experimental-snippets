- Handles high-dimensional data and mitigates overfitting

## Methodology
1. **Data Preparation**: The dataset is loaded and preprocessed, handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Random search is performed to explore a wide range of hyperparameter combinations for the random forest classifier.
3. **Model Training**: The random forest classifier is trained using the optimal hyperparameters obtained from the random search.
4. **Model Evaluation**: The trained model is evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Feature Importance**: The feature importance scores are calculated to identify the most influential features in the dataset.
