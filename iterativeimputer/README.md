# Multivariate Imputation Framework

This project introduces an advanced multivariate imputation framework that utilizes the IterativeImputer library to effectively handle complex missing data patterns in high-dimensional datasets.

## Features
- Leverages the relationships and correlations among multiple variables for accurate imputations
- Preserves the integrity of the data and improves the performance of downstream machine learning models
- Demonstrates expertise in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and advanced imputation techniques
- Showcases the superiority of the iterative imputation approach over traditional single-variable imputation methods
- Provides a powerful solution for data scientists and researchers working with incomplete datasets

## Methodology
1. **Data Loading**: The dataset with missing values is loaded and explored to understand the extent and patterns of missingness.
2. **Iterative Imputation**: The IterativeImputer library is utilized to impute missing values by iteratively modeling each feature with missing values as a function of other features.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Additional features or transformations may be applied to capture complex relationships and improve imputation accuracy.
4. **Model Training**: Various machine learning models are trained on the imputed dataset to evaluate the impact of the multivariate imputation approach.
5. **Model Evaluation**: The trained models are evaluated using appropriate metrics to assess the effectiveness of the imputation framework in improving model performance.
